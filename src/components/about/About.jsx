            <p>
                    Mafia Moves is a community collective that was created from the blueprints ​of a number of 
                    significant role models to engage the upcoming generations. We focus heavily on building 
                    identities, helping identify their potentials and altering the socioeconomic barriers many 
                    people face within their communities. The whole idea of Mafia Moves is to get the whole community 
                    exploring something different through positive engagement and movement. We don’t just run, we share 
                    experiences, educate, support and empower each other while covering the importance of physical 
                    and emotional wellbeing. We are a safe space for beginners and experienced movers. Just make 
                    sure you bring your POSITIVE VIBES and ENERGY along with you!
