Prototype Website I designed for my running group, made using React.js. Ended up revamping the old Wix website instead, see official website here: 
In the project directory, you can run: https://www.mafiamoves.co.uk/

Instructions:

1. Ensure NodeJS is configured properly on your device
2. open terminal
3. run `npm install` to install react and needed packages
4. run `npm start` to start web app
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
